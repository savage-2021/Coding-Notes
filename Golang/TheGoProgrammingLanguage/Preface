- Introduced in 2007, announced in 2009
- Like C, maxium effect, minimum means
- An open source language 
- Especially well suited for building infrastrute like networrked servers, and tools and systems for programmers
    -> But it is a general purpose language
- It is a popular replacement for untyped scripting languages, because it balances expressiveness with safety 
    -> Go programs typically run faster than programs writteen in dynamic languages, and suffer far fewercrashes due to unexpected type errors

Origin Paths:
    Academic Works: CSP (Hoare) -> Squeak (Cardelli&Pike) -> Newsqueak (Pike, 1989) -> Alef (Winterbottom)
    Languages: Algol -> Pascal -> Modula-2 -> Oberon -> Oberon-2
               Algol -> C 

    - Rob Pike and others began to experiment with CSP implementations as actual languages 
        -> 1st was Squeak (A language for communicating with mice)

The Go Project
    - "Complexity is mltiplicative": fixing a rpoblems by making one part of the system more cpmlex slowly but surely adds complexity to other parts
    - Features missing that are common in other languages:
        numeric conversions, no constructors or destructors, no operator overloading, no default parameter valyes, no inheritance, no generics, no exceptions, no macros, no function annottions, no thread local storage
    - Go has a simpler typed system than most other typed languages
    - Go encourages awareness of contemporary compuster system design, particularly the importance of locality 
    - Go's structs and arrays hold their elements directly, 
        requiring less storage and fewer allocations and pointer indirections than languages use indirect fields
    - Go's concurrency is based on CSP, for the modern parallel computer 
        -> The variable size stacks of Go's lightweight threads or goroutines are initially small enough, that creating millions is practical 
    - Go's standard library provides clean building blocks and APIs for I/O, text processing, grapphics, netowkring, cryto etc, and distributed applications
