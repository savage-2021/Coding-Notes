- If things are complicated, make them look compolicated to stick out to the next reader 
- Accept interfaces, return structs 
    - Mke the input interface as general as possible, remember functions should only do one thing and one thing well 
    - Rethiink the function name once it only does one thing and takes one interface
- Keep all successfuly statements to the left, so you can follow the code down the page.
    - This is so the code flows nicely
