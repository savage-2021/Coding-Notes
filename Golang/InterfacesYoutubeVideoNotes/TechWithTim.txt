- Very important and powerful inside any typed languages 
- An interfce is a way of looking at a set of related objects or types
- Its a way of abstracting groups of types, into another datastructure
- WHen trying to access a slice of a number of interfaces, you can only access the interface's methods, not the types in it
    -> We look a objects in the interface lens, not the type lens 
- You can use interfaces as any types, parameter types, map types, etc.
- Its good practice to always pass the pointer when making a datastrucre of interfaces, just because if you need access to the pointer 
    you have it, and you can still access the methods
- OBjects can implement as many interfaces as you want
