- If something moves liek a duck, and swims liek a duck, then it is a duck (duck typing)
- If an object satisfies an interface's methods, then we say it is of that type's interface 
- An interace is a protocol, it is an abstract type
- Interfaces decouple different types from each other 
    -> The types don't need to know anything about each other, except the interface
- Opposite of abstract types, are concrete types
- the bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction
- You can compare interface values with other values
