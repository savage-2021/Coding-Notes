The Difference between Concurrency and Parallelism

- Difference between concurrency and parallelism turns unto a very powerful abstraction when modeling your code, that go takes advnatage of
    -> Concurrency is a properpty of code; parallelism is a property of the running program
    -> If you run code on a machine with only one core, it will run sequentially, no matter if the code was written concurrently
    -> The CPU context switches to share time between different programs, and makes it appear that the program is runing in parallel 
    -> We do not write parallel code, only concurrent code that we hope wil run in parallel
    -> Atomicity; the bounds by which two or more operatinos could be considered parallel 
- Why is concurrency hard?
    -> Race conditions, deadlocks, livelocks, and starvation
