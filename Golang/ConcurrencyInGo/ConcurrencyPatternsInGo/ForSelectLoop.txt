The for-select Loop
Something you'll see over and over again in Go programs is the for-select loop 
2 Reasons for this pattern:
    - Sending Iteration Variables out on a Channel 
        -> Often times you'll want to convert somtehing that can be iterated into values on a channel 
    - Looping infinitely waiting to be stopped 
        -> this is stopped with a done case
