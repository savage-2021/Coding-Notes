Object Orientated Programming - The Go Way
-> Radically different approach

- Key Concepts
    -> Does not support inheritance 
        -> Inheritance has significant drawbacks, especially when it comes to large programs 
        -> Go supports aggregation and embedding exslusively (composition)
        -> If a type in a struct is annoymous, then it is an embedded type 
        -> In Go we use terms types and values instead of class/object/instance 
        -> Without inheritance, there are no virtual functions.
            -> Go's answer to this is to support type-safe duck typing 
    -> Interfaces
